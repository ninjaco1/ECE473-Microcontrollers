//Inclass Exercise (switch bounce)
//R. Traylor 7.15.2020

//The code below can reveal how 2 debouncing methods differ and how their
//timing can effect the results of sampling mechanical switches. Interrupts 
//from Timer Counter 0 provide a way to vary the sampling period of a 
//pushbutton switch on the AVR board. The number of pushbutton pushes
//are displayed on the LCD display.

//When the sampling interval is correct, you should see the display count
//increment by one for each button push with little delay. With too long a
//delay, you may be able to hit the switch quickly and not have it detected.
//With too little delay, it could count multiple hits when you have only 
//pushed the button once. 

//Try different pushbuttons and see which creates the most bouncing. They ls
//can vary greatly or not at all. Then, for each sampling method, vary the 
//sampling time and and note any difference. Use the #ifdef statements to 
//enable or disable debouncing.

//Keep a note of your findings so in later labs you'll have the approximate
//debouncing timing to use. Note that every bodies answers will probably 
//differ somewhat. There are few "right" or "wrong" answers.

//Note: "git" must be installed first. If necessary, "sudo apt install git"

//First, save this file as switch_bounce.c
//Then, download the required files from my area and from github:
//wget http://www.ece.orst.edu/~traylor/ece473/inclass_exercises/io_ports/switch_bounce/Makefile
//git clone https://github.com/rltraylor/hd44780_driver.git

//Finally, try the different debouncing methods and different delays between samples.
//
//The PORTD pin that exhibits the "most" bounce (0-7) : ___
//
//With switch debouncer enabled:
//  too fast, bounces counted            :   _______ (ns or mS)
//
//  too slow, misses fast button pushes  :   _______ (ns or mS)
//
//Without switch debouncer:
//  too fast, bounces counted            :   _______ (ns or mS)
//
//  too slow, misses fast button pushes  :   _______ (ns or mS)
